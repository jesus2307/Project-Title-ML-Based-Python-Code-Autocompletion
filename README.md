# Project-Title-ML-Based-Python-Code-Autocompletion
# Machine Learning-Based Code Autocompletion Tool

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
In this project, you will develop a machine learning-based code autocompletion tool for Python code snippets using PyTorch. Code autocompletion suggests the next token, word, or line in a source file, streamlining the coding process and improving developer productivity.

### Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain experience applying natural language processing (NLP) concepts to code data.
- Learn to structure and train machine learning (ML) models using PyTorch.
- Improve data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation skills for predictive tasks.
- Practice reporting technical results and justifying model design choices.

## 2. Project Description

### Context and Scenario
Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors often provide code suggestions to speed up coding. In this project, your task is to build a simplified version of such a tool. The model will be trained on a dataset of Python code files and should predict the next token given a sequence of previous tokens.

### Requirements and Deliverables

#### Main Deliverables
- A written report documenting the entire project pipeline, including model architecture, training procedure, evaluation metrics, and a discussion of results.
- A working Python codebase, using PyTorch for the model implementation. This should include scripts or notebooks for:
  - **Data preprocessing and tokenization**
  - **Model definition** (e.g., a neural language model or transformer-based architecture)
  - **Training and validation routines**
  - **Trained version of the model**
  - **Inference to demonstrate code autocompletion** (e.g., given a partial code snippet, generate the next token or line)

#### Execution Instructions
Provide clear instructions in the `README.md` file or report on how to:
- Install required dependencies (`PyTorch`, `tokenizers`, etc.).
- Run the training scripts (e.g., `python train.py`).
- Evaluate the model (e.g., `python evaluate.py`).
- Perform inference for code autocompletion (e.g., `python autocomplete.py --input "def my_function("`).

#### Format and Length
- **Report:** Approximately 3-4 pages, including:
  - Introduction and objectives
  - Methodology (data, model, training, evaluation)
  - Results and discussion
  - References (if any)
- **Code:** Organized into appropriate directories (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `models/`, `scripts/`), with comments and docstrings to ensure readability.

## 3. Data and Model Suggestions

### Data Sources
You may use publicly available Python code datasets (e.g., GitHub repositories, open-source projects). Ensure that the dataset is large enough to train a meaningful model. You are free to adapt existing tokenization or preprocessing scripts, but you must explain how they work.

Example dataset: [https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150)

### Model Architecture
You can choose from a simple **RNN-based language model** or a **transformer-based model** (like a GPT-style architecture) implemented in PyTorch. Make sure to explain the reasoning behind your model choice and how it works.

## 4. Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
Evaluate your model using at least one of the following metrics:
- **Cross-entropy loss**
- **Accuracy of predicting the next token**
- **Perplexity**

### Qualitative Evaluation
In addition to metrics, showcase several example completions to illustrate the modelâ€™s behavior and improvements over time.

## 6. Adaptation of Existing Solutions and Use of ChatGPT

### Allowed Usage
Students are free to adapt existing solutions found online, clone GitHub code samples, or utilize ChatGPT for hints and code segments. However, you must clearly explain in the report:
- Which parts of the code were adapted and from where.
- What prompts or guidance were taken from ChatGPT, and how they influenced the solution.
- The rationale behind each chosen solution and any modifications made to fit the project requirements.

âš  **Failure to provide clear attribution and explanation may affect your grade.**

## 7. Collaboration, Academic Integrity, and Policies

### Group Work
- Groups of up to **3 students** are allowed. Please list all group members and their respective contributions in the reportâ€™s appendix.

### Academic Integrity
- **All external code or inspirations must be cited.**
- **Direct copy-pasting from sources without attribution is prohibited.**
- **Properly credit all external libraries, tutorials, and ChatGPT responses.**

---

## 8. Submission and Discussion Format

### Submission Platform
- Submit the code and report (**PDF format for the report**) via email by the stated deadlines.
- Include a `README.md` file with setup and execution instructions.

### Discussions
- On the specified discussion date, each group will:
  - Present their approach
  - Show short demos of their code running
  - Answer questions related to their implementation

The discussion may cover model choices, coding decisions, and understanding underlying ML concepts.
